Here’s a **practical, *Advanced Spring Boot 4.0* training course outline** you can use for workshops, classroom training, bootcamps, or self-study. It’s focused on real-world skills — including **Spring Boot 4.x features, microservices, observability, security, data access, testing, and deployment** — pulled together from up-to-date Spring Boot training topics and advanced modules that appear in real courses and curricula. ([Coursera][1])
